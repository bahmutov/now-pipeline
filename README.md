## First time contributors

This repo is [first time OSS contributor friendly](http://www.firsttimersonly.com/).
See [these issues](https://github.com/bahmutov/now-pipeline/labels/first-timers-only)
to contribute in meaningful way.

## What and why

I am [super excited](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/think-inside-the-box/)
about [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now) tool; this is the "missing CI tool"
for it. A single command `now-pipeline`

- deploys new version
- tests it
- switches alias to the new deployment
- takes down the old deployment

Should be enough to automatically update the server or service running in
the cloud without breaking anything.

## Install and use

```sh
npm i -g now-pipeline
```

Set `NOW_TOKEN` CI environment variable with a token that you can get from
[Zeit account page](https://zeit.co/account#api-tokens)

Add CI command to `now-pipeline`. By default it will execute `npm test`
and will pass the deployed url as `NOW_URL` environment variable. You can
customize everything.

## Example

Simple Travis commands

```yml
script:
  # after unit tests
  - npm i -g now-pipeline
  - now-pipeline
```

Prune existing deploys (if they do not have an alias) and show the deploy.

```yml
script:
  - npm i -g now-pipeline
  - now-pipeline-prune
  - now-pipeline
  - now-pipeline-list
```

Set [domain alias](https://zeit.co/world) if there is no existing one

```yml
script:
  - npm i -g now-pipeline
  - now-pipeline --alias foo.domain.com
```

Pass in path to be used as deploy directory

```yml
script:
  - npm i -g now-pipeline
  - now-pipeline --dir your/directory
```

Pass test command and name of the environment variable for deployed url

```yml
script:
  - npm i -g now-pipeline
  - now-pipeline --as HOST --test "npm run e2e"
```

## Example projects

* [todomvc-express](https://github.com/bahmutov/todomvc-express/blob/master/.travis.yml)
* [express-sessions-tutorial](https://github.com/bahmutov/express-sessions-tutorial/blob/master/.travis.yml)
* [test-semantic-deploy-with-now](https://github.com/bahmutov/test-semantic-deploy-with-now)

## Additional bin commands

* `now-pipeline-list` - see the current deploys for the current project
* `now-pipeline-prune` - remove all non-aliased deploys for the current project

You can pass custom test command to the pipeline to be used after deploying
fresh install using `--test "command"` argument. The command will get `NOW_URL`
environment variable with new install. For example

```sh
npm i -g now-pipeline
now-pipeline --test "npm run prod-test"
```

where the `package.json` has

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prod-test": "e2e-test $NOW_URL"
  }
}
```

## Details

* `now-pipeline` uses [Zeit API](https://zeit.co/api) via [now-client](https://github.com/zeit/now-client).
* You can see the list of recent actions at [Zeit dashboard](https://zeit.co/dashboard).
* It discovers files to send using [pkgd](https://github.com/inikulin/pkgd),
  you can see the files by using the following command
  (read [Smaller published NPM modules](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/smaller-published-NPM-modules/) for more details)
```sh
t="$(npm pack .)"; wc -c "${t}"; tar tvf "${t}"; rm "${t}"
```
* file `.npmignore` is considered an optional file

## Related

* [next-update](https://github.com/bahmutov/next-update) is a similar
  "if tests pass, upgrade" tool for your NPM dependencies.
